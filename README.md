# LETSGROWMORE-DATA-SCIENCE-TASK
I'm grateful for the opportunity to intern in the field of Data Science and work on projects provided by @LetsGrowMore. I'm excited to learn and grow with each task. Here's a brief about the tasks:

**Task 1: Iris Flowers Classification ML Project (Beginner Level)**

This project is often referred to as the "Hello World" of Machine Learning. The Iris Flowers dataset is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, especially how to load and handle data. Since it's a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.

**Task 2: Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM (Beginner Level)**

In this task, I will be using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network, to predict and forecast stock market trends.

**Task 3: Music Recommendation (Beginner Level)**

This task involves building a music recommender system that suggests songs to users based on their listening patterns.

**Task 4: Image to Pencil Sketch with Python (Beginner Level)**

In this task, I will be converting an image into a pencil sketch using Python. This involves reading the image in RBG format, converting it to grayscale, inverting the grayscale image, and then creating the pencil sketch by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image.

**Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis on Dataset - Terrorism (Intermediate Level)**

As a security/defense analyst, I will be analyzing a terrorism dataset to find out the hot zone of terrorism.

**Task 6: Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm (Intermediate Level)**

In this task, I will be creating a Decision Tree classifier and visualizing it graphically. The purpose is to predict the right class accordingly when we feed any new data to this classifier.

**Task 7: Develop A Neural Network That Can Read Handwriting (Intermediate Level)**

This task involves beginning a neural network machine learning project with the MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Challenge and using Tensorflow and CNN.

**Task 8: Next Word Prediction (Advanced Level)**

In this task, I will be training a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using Tensorflow and Keras library to predict the next word.

**Task 9: Handwritten equation solver using CNN (Advanced Level)**

This task involves building a mathematical equation solver using character and symbol recognition through image processing and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

**Task 10: ML Facial recognition to detect mood and suggest songs accordingly (More Advanced Level)**

In this final task, I will be developing a machine learning model that uses facial recognition to detect mood and suggest songs accordingly.

Stay tuned for more updates on my journey with #lgmvip. Special thanks to Mr. Aman Kesarwani and the entire @LetsGrowMore team for this opportunity.
